# Readings Audio

Another add-on for Anki, mainly targeted at Japanese learners. The goal is to add audio to Kanji vocabulary cards corresponding to On- and Kunyomi readings. The idea of this plug-in was to mainly get those readings via the [Download Audio plug-in](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/3100585138), however it turned out that not all possible readings could be found there, so that this resource needs to be completed by recordings of missing readings (which is something I haven't done so far).

## Current status

**Development halted; will not work out of the box.** I definitely had it running before (so up to some limitations, this is a working example), but am not currently using it, nor have I tested it with other people's setup. Thus, this might mainly be interested in people who have some experience with Anki add-ons and can get it to work. I still think it's a pretty cool thing to have, so if someone would pick this up or join forces with me to finish this and make this into a proper Add-on, I would greatly appreciate it. 

## Installation

* Needs the ```python2``` ```romkan``` module, e.g. available [here](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/romkan), or via installation with ```pip``` or ```easy_install```.
* Needs the [Download Audio plug-in](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/3100585138)
